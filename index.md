# Hi, I'm **Saphal Patro.**

I develop software (and occasionally convince computers to behave).

Software Engineer at [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com)

## Projects

- **Hermes Profile Transformer** — Turns opaque Hermes JS runtime traces into something you can actually read in Chrome DevTools. Think of it as archaeology for JavaScript performance.
