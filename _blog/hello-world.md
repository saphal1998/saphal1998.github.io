# Hello world!

So, this is it huh?! This is where I start to literally just write whatever the fudge I want to. Hmm, interesting. 
Golang is awesome. C++ is too complex. Rust can rust in some corner of the world that is too awesome for me to even get into.

I understand that frontend is easy, but my god, modern frontend has way too many things I need to understand, so I might as well store notes here, I'll use this blog site more like a daily journal of whatever it is I learned that day. Not gonna tell anyone, because what is the point lol, don't want anyone to judge me for my absolutely lukewarm takes. 

Also, testing mermaid?

<div class="mermaid">
graph LR
  A[Start] --> B{Is it working?}
  B -->|Yes| C[Celebrate]
  B -->|No| D[Fix it]
  D --> B
</div>
